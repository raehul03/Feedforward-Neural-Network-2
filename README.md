Wine Quality Prediction with Neural Network
This project uses a Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) to predict wine quality from UCI's Wine Quality Dataset.
I used the concepts  Dropout & L2 regularization, EarlyStopping & ReduceLROnPlateau for better training.
Predicts wine quality & visualizes results.
